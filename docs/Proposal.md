Research Goals:

Develop a method to distinguish between humans and bots (and probably cyborgs) based on the data available.


Data:

Collect data (not decided) from Twitter by using ? . Use Social Honeypot Dataset for reference.


Methods:

Based on the papers I've read, most of this kind of studies use classifiers on some featured data collected from users to distinguish between humans and bots. I would like to propose to go the same way, trying to find and test more kinds of data and more algorithms that can be used in this topic.


Evaluation:

Evaluation will be based on the pricision of the classification between humans and bots. Use Social Honeypot Dataset for bot reference of known bot accounts and legitimate accounts.
