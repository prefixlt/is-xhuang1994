Here are three (fictitional!) project ideas:

1. **Lotto Predictor**: I will design an algorithm to predict the winning lotto numbers based on the most popular numbers on Twitter. To do so, I will use the Twitter Streaming API to collect a sample of messages for each week, then count the frequency of each number. I will then guess the week's winning lotto numbers by combining the most popular numbers. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy and total earnings. (I really like this one so I leave it here.)

2. Twitter Tweets Classifier: I will design a learning system for various categories such as sports, entertainment, business, politics, hollywood etc. The classifier will predict the category for incoming tweets. To do so, I will collect a number of twittes with their classification and try to build a classifier, train it and test it. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy.

3. Fraud Detection: Some users on social media intentionally creates hype about particular products. I will design an algorithm to detect fraudulent users and activities. To do so, I will collect a sample of users and posts that are marked as fraudulent, and build a learning system based on the collected data. I will then train it and test it. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy.
