Here are three (fictitional!) project ideas:


2. Twitter Tweets Classifier: I will design a learning system for various categories such as sports, entertainment, business, politics, hollywood etc. The classifier will predict the category for incoming tweets. To do so, I will collect a number of twittes with their classification and try to build a classifier, train it and test it. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy.

3. Fraud Detection: Some users on social media intentionally creates hype about particular products. I will design an algorithm to detect fraudulent users and activities. To do so, I will collect a sample of users and posts that are marked as fraudulent, and build a learning system based on the collected data. I will then train it and test it. I will evaluate over 10 weeks and report accuracy.
